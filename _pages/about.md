I'm an assistant professor of data science at Purdue Libraries and School of Information Studies. My research insterests include data science education and information science using machine learning, Natural Language Processing(NLP), and computer vision. I'm also an remote sensing scientist using optical imagery and lidar to understand our land ecosystems and the changing climates. 

Please check out my [data science libguide](https://guides.lib.purdue.edu/DataScience) for open education resources to learn data science, machine learning, text analysis, and python programming. Also, check out free workshops on data science and machine learning conducted by [D-VELoP lab](https://guides.lib.purdue.edu/d-velop) at Purdue Libraries and School of Information Studies, and we keep posting new topics every fall and spring semesters.
